# Digital Literacy Gap in Regional Victoria

## 1. Introduction

Imagine sitting down to pay a bill, book a medical appointment, or help a child submit homework — and every click feels slow, confusing, or like something might go wrong.

For many people in regional Victoria, this isn't a rare annoyance. It's part of everyday life.

In 2025, digital confidence is as important as reading and writing. Yet across the state, your postcode still plays a big role in how easily you can learn and use digital skills. And the gap isn't just about internet connection — it's about access to training, trusted support, and the chance to learn at your own pace.

## 2. What the Digital Literacy Gap Looks Like Today

Digital literacy means more than owning a device. It's the ability to:

- solve simple tech problems
- stay safe from scams
- fill out online forms
- join a video appointment
- use digital tools at work, in business, or at home

In larger urban areas, people build these skills naturally because digital services are everywhere — in schools, workplaces, libraries, and community hubs.

In many regional towns, the experience is different:

- fewer local mentors or helpers
- limited structured training
- fewer chances to practice new skills
- lower confidence among older residents and households with tight budgets

> "Good internet helps — but confidence and support make the biggest difference."

## 3. Why It Matters for Everyday Life

### Education

Children now complete homework, research projects, and lessons online. Parents often want to help but feel unsure where to start.

### Small Business

Local cafés, tradies, tourism operators, and shops increasingly rely on online bookings, digital payments, and social media. Many business owners want to adapt — they just need guidance and someone to show them how.

### Health and Essential Services

Telehealth, MyGov, Medicare, banking, and job applications all require digital skills. Without confidence, everyday tasks take longer and can easily become stressful.

## 4. What's Improving Across Regional Victoria

Many communities are making impressive progress:

- libraries in towns like Ballarat, Bendigo, and the Latrobe Valley run friendly digital workshops
- neighbourhood houses provide basic computer help for seniors, migrants, and jobseekers
- schools and TAFEs are weaving digital learning into daily lessons
- councils across Gippsland, Goulburn Valley, the Mallee, and Greater Geelong are adopting digital inclusion plans
- statewide programs like Connecting Victoria are strengthening both infrastructure and community capability

Progress is real — but uneven. Larger towns benefit from more stable support, while smaller shires often rely on volunteers and short-term grants.

## 5. Why the Gap Still Persists

Several factors continue to widen the divide:

- **Less daily exposure** — fewer digital touchpoints in everyday life mean fewer chances to build confidence naturally
- **Limited training options** — many towns lack TAFEs, tech classes, workshops, or dedicated mentors
- **Cost and device barriers** — older laptops, shared devices, or phones not suited for learning make practice difficult
- **Generational differences** — rapid change can feel overwhelming, especially without someone nearby to provide reassurance

> "It's not about ability — it's about access, opportunity, and support."

## 6. Community Leadership: The Real Game Changer

The strongest improvements come from local, community-led action:

- councils creating digital roadmaps
- libraries offering one-on-one tech help
- neighbourhood houses running beginner-friendly sessions
- business groups helping local traders adopt digital tools
- schools partnering with tech organisations

When programs reflect local needs — whether that's agri-tech for farming communities or online booking systems for tourism towns — people learn faster and feel more supported.

## 7. What Still Needs to Happen

Experts highlight three priorities:

1. **Stable, long-term funding** — Short-term grants create short-term gains. Reliable funding allows communities to run ongoing workshops and mentoring.
2. **Affordable, reliable devices** — People can't build digital confidence on devices that are outdated or unreliable.
3. **Digital learning embedded in everyday life** — Training should be part of schools, libraries, health services, business support, and community programs.

Every community is unique. A tailored, local approach works best.

## 8. How People Can Get Started

### Small Business Owners

Explore training through libraries, TAFEs, or online short courses. Even one session can make the next step easier.

### Parents and Students

Ask teachers or librarians for help with research tools, digital safety, or beginner coding platforms. Many resources are free.

### Community Groups and Leaders

Apply for grants that fund devices, digital mentors, or regular workshops. Some of the most effective programs start small.

### Local Councils

Grow and promote digital-inclusion plans so residents have both the access and skills they need.

## 9. Conclusion: Skills Are the New Infrastructure

Regional Victoria is moving forward — but the digital literacy gap is still holding many communities back. Better internet helps, but real progress depends on investing in people, not just technology.

The good news? Local councils, libraries, schools, and community groups are already showing what works.

The challenge now is ensuring every town — no matter how remote — gets the same chance to build digital confidence.

Just like roads, electricity, and water, digital capability is essential infrastructure.

To build a fair and thriving future, we must invest not only in connection — but in the people who rely on it.
